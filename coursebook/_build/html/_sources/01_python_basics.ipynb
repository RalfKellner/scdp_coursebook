    "Python (from the comedy group Monty Python) is an interpreted programming language, meaning the written code needs to be \"translated\" to commands for the machine by a so called interpreter in order to be run. This apparent detour however makes for a better readability, writability and error location for us humans. Python is free to use and it's also free to contribute by writing own packages. A plethora of powerful packages are available which is one of the reasons for python's large popularity.\n",

    "There are many different ways to use python. The easiest and quickest way is to run it on external servers which include pre-defined environments. If you have a Google account you may want to go to your Google drive and open a Google Colaboratory as shown below."

    "Google colaboraties are in notebook format which include cells where python code can be execute and cells which can be used for writing text in, e.g., markdown format. While this is very useful and provides easy access, we aim to build a deeper understanding for python which is why we install it locally on your computer. This can be done in various ways. You need to install a python interpreter which can be accessed by different working environments. A simple way is to install the Anaconda distribution which not only installs the python interpreter, but, also many other packages and environments. Personally, I prefer to keep it a little cleaner which means installing the python interpreter first and choosing a development environment which you like. In my case, it is the combination of Python with VS Code. Another popular developer environment is PyCharm. I am going to assist your installation in the first week of the course. A good explanation can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)."

    "Even though it might be a little early to talk about virtual environments, I think it is helpful to know about them and use them from the beginning. Let us first talk about why we want to use them. Usually you will work with python in a project-oriented way. For instance, you may need to conduct certain data driven analysis for a seminar paper or you want to develop your powerful stock market trading strategy. Each project has its own goals and needs such as, e.g., getting and analyzing data by different models. \n",
    "\n",
    "The python distribution you installed is considered to be the *base* installation and comes along with some pre-installed packages which are listed in the [python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). However, other useful packages must be installed before you can use them. For instance popular packages such as *numpy*, *scipy*, *pandas*, *scikit-learn*, etc. These packages are installed by a package manager which usually is the ```pip``` for must users (conda or poetry would be alternatives). Not only that different packages may be needed for different projects, sometimes different versions of a package must be installed for different projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is very useful if every project can have its own safe space with its packages and settings needed for the project. This is exactly which is enabled by virtual environments. They can be created in your project folder on top of the python base installation by the ```python -m venv your_environment_name``` command. Once they are activated (or in VS Code defined to be used for a notebook), everything which is done stays in this environment and does not impact the global python installation nor other projects and their virtual environments. We are going to go through the creation and usage of virtual environments in the course step by step, so do not worry!"
